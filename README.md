### Welcome to my GitHub

## What you will see here?

 My 7-months journey of learning programming, starting from scratch, to where I am now.
 You will find projects that I've worked on, starting from simple HTML  + CSS, to using complex framework like React.
 I've also added exercises that I found them really useful in my learning process.
